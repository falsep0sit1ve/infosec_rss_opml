InfoSec RSS OPML
=========

This is the `InfoSec RSS OPML` project. The following are the project goals:

1. Provide an easy-to-import list of valuable, high signal:noise ratio infosec blogs, websites, and resources.

2. Continually cull, grow, and groom the list as resources change over time.

3. Make it stupid easy to stay on top of the infosec industry without drowning yourself in vendor-trash articles.


Getting Started
---------------
1. Find an RSS client that allows a bulk OPML import. 
2. Import the OPML file.
3. Remove resources you don't care for.


Recommended Readers
